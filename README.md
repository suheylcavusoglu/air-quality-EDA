# Air Quality - EDA - AQI Calculation

## Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment, Urbanism, and Climate Change - Air Quality Data Set

This dataset offers valuable insights into the air quality conditions recorded at the Kocaeli station over a substantial period, spanning from February 16, 2007, to August 8, 2023. The data set encompasses the following essential columns, each representing a specific air quality parameter:

- **Date:** The date when the air quality measurements were recorded.
- **PM10 (µg/m³):** This parameter represents the concentration of particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less in the air. PM10 levels are crucial indicators of air pollution, as these fine particles can have significant health impacts when inhaled.
- **PM2.5 (µg/m³):** Similar to PM10, this column measures the concentration of even finer particulate matter, with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. PM2.5 levels provide insights into finer particles that can penetrate deeper into the respiratory system, posing additional health risks.
- **SO2 (µg/m³):** This column denotes the concentration of sulfur dioxide, a gas primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels. Elevated SO2 levels can lead to respiratory issues and contribute to the formation of acid rain.
- **NO2 (µg/m³):** Nitrogen dioxide levels, indicated in this column, stem mainly from vehicle emissions and industrial activities. High NO2 concentrations can cause respiratory problems and contribute to smog formation.
- **NOX (µg/m³):** The NOX column encompasses various nitrogen oxide compounds, typically released during combustion processes. These compounds play a significant role in air pollution, impacting human health and the environment.
- **NO (µg/m³):** Nitric oxide levels, presented in this column, are produced during combustion, particularly in vehicle engines. NO is a precursor to NO2 and plays a role in atmospheric chemistry.

This comprehensive data set serves as a valuable resource for various data analysis applications, including exploratory data analysis and machine learning. It offers a window into the dynamics of air quality, allowing us to gain insights, identify trends, and make informed decisions in the context of environmental and public health considerations.
